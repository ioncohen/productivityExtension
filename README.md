# Lock In - A Chrome extension to improve productivity

This is an extension for Google Chrome (and soon Firefox as well) which allows users to easily and conveniently curate a list of sites that should be blocked during work sessions.

## Features
* Simple interface makes it easy to add sites to your block list and begin their first work session
* User can choose to cancel a work session by typing a custom passphrase
* User can choose to temporarily unblock a specific site by typing in the passphrase. 
  * This allows for flexibility, in case a user needs to access a blocked site.
  * Reduces risk of user uninstalling or disabling the extension out of frustration
* User can enable "distraction-free" versions of various sites, removing things like infinite scrolls of content and algorithmic recommendations.
* Block list allows fine grained control over blocking with exceptions (-) and wildcards (*).

## Future Plans
* The extension is currently published privately to the Chrome web store while our team tests and finalizes the extension. It will be released in January, 2025
* Firefox and Microsoft Edge versions are in development.
